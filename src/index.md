## **🌍 The Need**

In the remote mountains of Eastern Guatemala, families live in **extreme poverty**:

* ❌ Children suffer from malnutrition and preventable disease.

* 🚶‍♀️ Contaminiated drinking water leads to parasites and disease.

* 🌵 Drought and famine threaten survival.

⚠️ *Without help, children die from hunger and sickness every year.*

## **❤️ Our Response**

**Outreach for World Hope (OWH)** partners with local communities to bring practical, life-changing support:

* 💖 **Child Sponsorship** – monthly food, vitamins, medical care, and school support.

* 🩺 **Medical & Dental Care** – mobile clinics in remote villages.

* 🎒 **Education** – classrooms, supplies, and teacher training.

* 💧 **Clean Water** – each bucket water filter provides up to **100,000 gallons** of safe, clean drinking water for an entire family.

* 🔥 **Safe Stoves** – replace cooking over an indoor open fire with vented stoves, preventing **lung damage**, reducing **burns**, and keeping homes **cooler** since 90% less wood is needed.

* 🌱 **Agriculture** – seeds, training, and sustainable farming methods.

➡️ *Every gift makes a difference. Every child matters.*

## **📖 A Real Story of Hope**

“Mauricia was eight years old when we met her. She was starving, her hair had fallen out, and her chances of survival were only 10%. Today, through child sponsorship, she is thriving, in school, and full of life.”

“Little Darwin was only 3 pounds when he was born, and he had dropped to 2 pounds when we saw him.  He only had a matter of days or hours left in his life at that point, but he was a fighter\!  Through the OWH sponsorship program, he has since grown to be a vibrant, happy, strong boy.  It has been a joy to visit him during our mission trips over the years.
